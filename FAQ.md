**Why Grappelli?**

From our point of view, the Admin-Interface is one of the most important things for clients/customers and therefore it should just look amazing.

We tried to give the Admin-Interface a more "grown-up" and coherent look & feel and added some features.

**Why TinyMCE?**

With all the crappy Rich-Text-Editors out there, this one is ok (don´t ask how long it took to style the plug-in windows ...).

**Instead of just skinning the original Django Admin-Interface, why is Grappelli not totally build up from scratch?**

Because if there are new features in the Admin-Interface, we are planning to integrate them as fast as possible using Grappelli. Therefore, Grappelli heavily relies on the Original Interface.

**Who made Grappelli?**

Grappelli is made and maintained by Patrick Kranzlmüller, Axel Swoboda and Klemens Mantzos of vonautomatisch (http://vonautomatisch.at). jQuery-features partly written by Maxime Haineault (http://haineault.com).
