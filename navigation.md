# Customizing Navigation Areas #

With Grappelli, you get 2 additional Navigation Areas:
  1. The **Bookmarks** at the top of every page - right beside the title.
  1. The **Sidebar Navigation** at the Admin-Interface main page.

## Bookmarks ##

Each user can add/remove specific admin-pages to this area and manage his/her Bookmarks.

As a superuser, you can manage all Bookmarks.

## Sidebar Navigation ##

The **Sidebar Navigation** can/should contain all different sections/applications of your admin-site as well as links to external ressources. Please be aware that you have to **manually assign Editors/Groups** to each of the Navigation Items (because not every Editor needs the same Navigation).

Load the fixtures to get a better idea of whatÂ´s this about.
